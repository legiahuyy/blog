### Timezone of date

In order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only setup the `timezone` of `_config.yml` but also provide the the postâ€™s timezone in field `date` of its Front Matter block. Format: `+/-TTTT`, e.g. `+0800`.

### Categories and Tags

The `categories` of each post is designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in `tags` can be zero to infinity.

The list of posts belonging to the same *category*/*tag* is recorded on a separate page. At the same time, the number of these *category*/*tag* type pages is equal to the number of `categories` / `tags` elements for all posts, which means that the two number must be exactly the same.
